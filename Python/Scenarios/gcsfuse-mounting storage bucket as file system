Using Cloud Storage bucket along with VM as a File system:
Here we use gcsfuse to attach storage to access files/folders in bucket, instead of disk we use storage.
Step1: create vm
step2: get gcsfuse from  "https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-install"
Go through steps in it or follow:
RUN:

* export GCSFUSE_REPO=gcsfuse-`lsb_release -c -s`
* echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.asc] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $GCSFUSE_REPO main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gcsfuse.list
* curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.asc

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gcsfuse

Attaching bucket:

* mkdir sumanth
* chmod 777 sumamnth
* gcsfuse bucket_name sumanth
* df -h (you can see bucket mounted in sumanth folder)

Go to sumanth and ls (you can see files nd folders inside it)
cp select/file /path/to/destination

*what you can do?
No need of using gsutil to access any files or copy any files, you can simply copy files directly from local

*To unmount bucket:
fusermount -u /home/sumo1998sumanth/sumanth(/path/to/mount/point)
